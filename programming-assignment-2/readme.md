# Instructions on how to run
In the SWI-Prolog command line, run the following commands:
1. `consult('D:\\source\\ai_portfolio\\programming-assignment-2\\coloring.pl').` (replace the path with the path to the pl file in your computer)
2. `coloring(M, [[a,b,c], [[b,c], [a,c], [a,b]]]).` (or any other graph, also you have to keep pressing `;` to see all results)
