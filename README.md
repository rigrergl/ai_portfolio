## Programming Assigment 1
This assignment implements some basic search algorithms:
- Depth-first search
- Iterative deepening search
- A* search (with two separate heuristics)

The code can be found [here](programming-assignment-1/main.py).

Instructions on how to run it can be found [here](programming-assignment-1/readme.md).

Sample input and output, as well as a short comparative analysis of the two heuristics used for the A* algorithm can be found [here](programming-assignment-1/Report.pdf)

The instructions provided by the professor for this assignment can be found [here](programming-assignment-1/assignment-instructions.pdf)
