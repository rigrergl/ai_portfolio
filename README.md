Repository for my Artificial Intelligence (CS4365) class

## Programming Assigment 1
This assignment implements some basic search algorithms:
- Depth-first search
- Iterative deepening search
- A* search (with two separate heuristics)

The code can be found [here](programming-assignment-1/main.py).

Instructions on how to run it can be found [here](programming-assignment-1/readme.md).

Sample input and output, as well as a short comparative analysis of the two heuristics used for the A* algorithm can be found [here](programming-assignment-1/Report.pdf)

The instructions provided by the professor for this assignment can be found [here](programming-assignment-1/assignment-instructions.pdf)

## Programming Assignment 2
This assigment involved writing a Prolog program to find an "admissible" coloring of a graph such that all adjacent nodes have different colors. The program finds all possible combinations of four colors (red, blue, yellow, and green) for the graph. The graph is represented as a list with two items, the first item is the list of vertices and the second item is the list of lists with adjacent vertices corresponding to the first list. 

The prolog program I wrote for this assignment can be found [here](https://github.com/rigrergl/ai_portfolio/blob/main/programming-assignment-2/coloring.pl).

Instructions on how to run my Prolog code can be found [here](https://github.com/rigrergl/ai_portfolio/blob/main/programming-assignment-2/readme.md).

A report, containing sample runs and a short analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/rigrergl/ai_portfolio/blob/main/programming-assignment-2/Report.pdf).

The original instructions provided by the professor can be found [here]().
